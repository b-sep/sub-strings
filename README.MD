# PROJECT: SUB STRINGS

## Introduction

This is a project based on [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-sub-strings) where i take a string and a array with substrings and output a hash linsting each substring as key and how many times it was found as a value. In this exercise i learn about the #scan method that iterates over a string matching the pattern.
